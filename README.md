This repository demonstrates a common but easily avoidable error in Dockerfiles. The original `Dockerfile` uses `ubuntu:latest`, which is an unstable base image because it can change unexpectedly between builds.  This causes unpredictable behavior in the final image.  The `apt-get` commands also fail in automated builds because they need the `-y` flag to automatically respond "yes" to prompts.  The `Dockerfile_solution.txt` provides a corrected version with a stable base image and the necessary `-y` flag.
